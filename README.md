# pdfstamper

Stamps PDF files with their name in the upper right corner. Clojure implementation of Christopher Suarez's Java-version [available here](http://feathertrail.blogspot.se/2013/10/stamp-pdf-with-its-file-name.html).

## Usage

You can give it either the name of a PDF file to stamp, or a directory, in which case it will process all PDF files in that directory.
